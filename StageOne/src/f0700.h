// *********************************************************************
//
//  Thanks for your interest in this position. In this preliminary
//  screen process, you are given the following native 32-bit C code:
//
//    1. Refactor/rewrite the code into a SOLID readable code
//       - A READABLE code should allow other programmers to fully
//         understand what the code is doing, by just glancing over it
//         (within 3-5 seconds) without having to read through lengthy
//         comments / documentation, thus improving the overall
//         productivity of the team
//       - A READABLE code should be "self-explanatory", short,
//         consistent, and properly structured that allow seamless
//         communication across team
//       - Keep in mind, there is no absolutely right/wrong way. But
//         we mostly interested in candidates who can boost the overall
//         productivity of the code review team. Here are few
//         suggestions you may consider:
//         - eliminate unnecessary pointer arithmetics
//         - eliminate unnecessary variables/loop/calculation
//         - keep it super simple, DON'T write code that only hardcore
//           programmers can understand; DO write high level code that
//           every programmers one can read
//
//    2. What strategy would you use to verify that your code is correct?
//
//    3. Explain what the code is trying to accomplish intuitively
//
//    4. Please show us how you accomplish all #1, #2, #3:
//       - Setup a project with Visual Studio 2015 (or higher) on Win7
//         so that we can verify that your code is working properly
//       - Version control your steps with Git to help our reviewers
//         to validate/review your code
//       - Zip your Git repo and email it back to us for further review
//
//  Good Luck!
